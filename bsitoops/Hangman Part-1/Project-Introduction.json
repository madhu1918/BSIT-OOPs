We will 'scaffold' this problem, guiding you through the creation of helper functions before you implement the actual game.<br>For this problem, you will implement a variation of the classic wordgame Hangman. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the rules, you may read all about it <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)\">click here to view resource.</a>.In this problem, the second player will always be the computer, who will be picking a word at random.<br>In this problem, you will implement a <b>function</b>, called hangman, that will start up and carry out an interactive Hangman game between a player and the computer."

			"text" : "You will want to do all of your coding for this problem within this file as well because you will be writing a program that depends on each function you write.<br><b>Requirements</b><br>Here are the requirements for your game:<br>1. The computer must select a word at random from the list of available words that was provided in <b>words.txt</b>.<br>2. The game must be interactive; the flow of the game should go as follows:<br><ul>  <li>At the start of the game, let the user know how many letters the computer's word contains.</li>  <li>Ask the user to supply one guess (i.e. letter) per round.</li>  <li>The user should receive feedback immediately after each guess about whether their guess appears in the computer's word.</li><li>After each round, you should also display to the user the partially guessed word so far, as well as letters that the user has not yet guessed.</li></ul> <br>3. Some additional rules of the game:<br><ul>  <li>A user is allowed 8 guesses. Make sure to remind the user of how many guesses s/he has left after each round. Assume that players will only ever submit one character at a time (A-Z).</li>  <li>A user loses a guess <b>only</b> when s/he guesses incorrectly.</li>  <li>If the user guesses the same letter twice, do not take away a guess - instead, print a message letting them know they've already guessed that letter and ask them to try again.</li><li>The game should end when the user constructs the full word or runs out of guesses. If the player runs out of guesses (s/he \"loses\"), reveal the word to the user when the game ends.</li></ul> <br><b>Sample Output</b><br><b>The output of a winning game should look like this..</b>"
